# LangChain Integration

> **Note**: This document covers LangChain concepts. For implementation details, see [EMBEDDINGS.md](./EMBEDDINGS.md) and [Knowledge Agent Guide](./KNOWLEDGE_AGENT.md).

## What is LangChain?

LangChain is a library that simplifies building **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipelines and integrations with LLMs, embeddings, and external sources.

## How We Use LangChain

In this project, LangChain concepts are applied for:

1. **RAG Pipeline Orchestration**: 
   - Question → Embedding → Similarity Search → Context → LLM Response

2. **Embedding Provider Integration**: 
   - Seamlessly integrate HuggingFace API for embeddings

3. **Search and Ranking**: 
   - Semantic search with cosine similarity
   - Relevance scoring and article ranking

4. **Execution Tracking**: 
   - Response time logging
   - Source attribution

## Implementation Architecture

```typescript
// LangChain-inspired flow (implemented in our services)
const ragPipeline = {
  retriever: embedding.service.ts,      // Semantic search
  context: context-loader.ts,           // Article loading  
  llm: groq.service.ts,                // Response generation
  orchestrator: knowledge-agent.service.ts  // Pipeline coordination
};
```

## Benefits

- **Modular Design**: Each component can be replaced independently
- **Provider Agnostic**: Can switch between different embedding APIs
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new retrieval methods or LLM providers
- **Observable**: Built-in logging and performance tracking

The semantic search system follows LangChain's RAG patterns while maintaining simplicity and avoiding unnecessary dependencies.

LangChain is a library that simplifies building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines and integrations with LLMs, embeddings, and external sources.
In your project, LangChain can be used to:

Orchestrate semantic search: receive the question, retrieve embeddings (locally, via Redis, or Hugging Face API), calculate similarity, and return the most relevant article.
Integrate different embedding providers (local, API, etc.) seamlessly.
Compose the RAG pipeline: search, ranking, response generation, source logging, and execution time tracking.
Summary:
You can use LangChain to build the search and response pipeline, regardless of how embeddings are generated (locally, Docker, or Hugging Face API).
In other words, LangChain is the “orchestrator” of the RAG flow, and the embedding source can be any provider — including the Hugging Face API.
